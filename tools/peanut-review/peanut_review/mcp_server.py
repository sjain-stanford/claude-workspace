"""MCP server exposing peanut-review tools for cursor agents.

Agents call structured MCP tools instead of Shell(peanut-review ...).
Eliminates the "prints commands instead of executing" problem with Gemini.

Usage:
    PEANUT_SESSION=/tmp/peanut-review/... python -m peanut_review.mcp_server

Configured in .cursor/mcp.json:
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "peanut-review": {
          "command": "python3",
